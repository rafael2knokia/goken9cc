/* dirwstat() by path, built portably on top of dirfwstat() by fd --
 * the write-side mirror of port/dirstat.c, same rationale. Used for
 * plan9, darwin, and windows -- linux has its own os/linux/
 * dirwstat.c instead (lib_core/libc/mkfile's DIRWSTATOFILES), see
 * that file's header comment for why.
 *
 * Known, accepted gap, same scope as BOOT/lib9/dirwstat.c (the
 * gcc-built reference this tree is meant to stop depending on, whose
 * own comment admits as much -- "BUG handle more"): renaming via
 * Dir.name is not implemented here, only mode/mtime/length (see
 * os/$GOOS/stat.c's dirfwstat()) -- NOT a gap on plan9 specifically,
 * whose dirfwstat() already renames natively through the wire
 * protocol (os/plan9/stat.c's own comment), so this simple wrapper is
 * genuinely enough there; darwin/windows still have the gap, same as
 * before utilities/files/mv.c's rename path exposed it for linux.
 * And opening ORDWR to reach a per-fd chmod/truncate/utime means a
 * currently-unwritable file (say mode 0444) can't have its mode
 * CHANGED via this path -- chmod(1)-style "make a read-only file
 * writable" needs a real path-based chmod(2), which this does not
 * call. No caller in this tree hits that second gap yet.
