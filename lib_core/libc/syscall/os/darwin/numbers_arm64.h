 * snapshot the rest of this file came from, because two of them are not
 * in that snapshot at all and the plan file's guess for one was wrong.
 *
 * getpid (20) and gettimeofday (116) are straightforward. The other two
 * are not, and both are cases where Darwin simply has no equivalent of
 * the Linux syscall:
 *
 * - There is NO getcwd syscall on Darwin, under any name. (Note
 *   docs/claude_notes/plan_syscalls.txt guessed __getcwd = 296 and
 *   flagged it unverified; 296 is in fact vm_pressure_monitor.) So
 *   getwd is built on fcntl(F_GETPATH) instead -- open the directory,
 *   ask the kernel that descriptor's path. This is the same idea as
 *   Plan9's fd2path, which is why os/darwin/getwd.c and
 *   os/plan9/getwd.c look alike and neither looks like linux's.
 * - There is NO nanosleep syscall either; Darwin implements it in
 *   libSystem over __semwait_signal. select(2) with only a timeout is
 *   the classic portable substitute and is a real syscall here, so
 *   os/darwin/time.c uses that.
 *
 * gettimeofday is marked NO_SYSCALL_STUB in syscalls.master, meaning
 * libSystem exports no automatic wrapper -- irrelevant to us, since we
 * trap directly, but it explains why it looks unusual there. Its third
 * argument (uint64_t *mach_absolute_time) is a Darwin addition; passing
 * nil asks for just the timeval.

 * syscall would already return the unified struct -- WRONG, disproven
 * empirically on a real macOS 26/Darwin 25 arm64 host: trap 189 still
