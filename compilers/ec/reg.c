/*
 * ec/reg.c -- the wasm "structuring" pass.
 *
 * Every other arch's regopt() turns a flat Prog list using pseudo-
 * registers into one using real hardware registers -- pure
 * optimization on already-correct code. wasm has no register file, so
 * there is nothing to optimize, but codgen() (compilers/cck/pgen.c)
 * still calls regopt(sp) unconditionally once per function, right
 * after that function's whole flat body (gbranch()/patch()'s ABR/
 * ABRIF placeholders, with to.offset holding a raw target pc exactly
 * like a real arch's D_BRANCH -- see txt.c) has been generated. ec
 * reuses that same hook for the analogous wasm-specific
 * transformation: turning the flat, PC-addressed branch list into
 * properly nested wasm block/loop/br/br_if.
 *
 * This works, without needing a general "relooper" for arbitrary
 * goto, because gen() only ever produces *reducible* control flow for
 * if/while/for/break/continue (the constructs ec's frontend recognizes
 * -- switch and arbitrary goto still diag() elsewhere). It does NOT
 * mean every branch-target span nests cleanly by construction, though
 * -- two real cases need fixing up before block/loop insertion:
 *   - A forward branch's *own* operand computation (an ABRIF's
 *     condition) can start well before the branch itself, and must
 *     stay inside whatever block wraps that branch's target (see
 *     safeopen()'s comment) -- otherwise the wrapping block resets
 *     the operand stack out from under it.
 *   - Two branch targets can genuinely partially overlap in the flat
 *     list -- e.g. an if/else's own "skip the else" jump sits inside
 *     the *test's* wrapping block (which closes right at the start of
 *     the else) but needs to reach past the whole if/else (see
 *     extendscopes()'s comment).
 * Both are fixed by widening a block's *open* point outward (always
 * safe -- see the comments where each happens); neither fixes a
 * branch whose *target* falls strictly inside another scope's body
 * while the branch itself sits outside it (as opposed to before it)
 * -- exactly what a C `for`/`do while`'s own entry jump needs
 * (skipping the first iteration's increment/test, landing partway
 * into what the back-edge treats as the loop). That case needs an
 * actual code-shape change instead: rotateloops() (below) physically
 * reorders the flat instructions into the standard "loop rotation"
 * shape (see rotateonce()'s own comment) so the entry jump never has
 * to land mid-loop again. It has to run on the already-compacted,
 * dead-code-free list (see findrotation()'s comment for why running
 * it any earlier reproduces the very violation it's trying to fix).
 * validatescopes() stays as a safety net for anything that shape
 * doesn't cover (arbitrary goto is still just diag()'d before it gets
 * this far, so nothing should reach it today).
 *
 * Five passes over the function's flat Prog list:
 *
 *   1. Jump-threading (resolve()/threadjumps()): any branch whose
 *      target is itself a bare unconditional ABR gets its target
 *      replaced by that ABR's own target, repeated to a fixed point.
 *      gen() emits exactly this kind of "trampoline" for breakpc/
 *      continpc: a pc value is captured *before* the placeholder that
 *      will later be patched to the real destination (see pgen.c's
 *      OWHILE/OFOR), so two placeholders often chain together before
 *      reaching the real target.
 *
 *   2. Dead code marking + compaction (markdead()/compact()): after
 *      threading, any Prog that is neither a fallthrough target of
 *      the previous live instruction (i.e. that instruction wasn't
 *      itself a terminator) nor a real branch target is dead. This
 *      eliminates the now-unreachable trampolines from (1), *and*
 *      elides the redundant trailing ARET codgen() always appends
 *      whether or not the function's body already returned on every
 *      path -- the general form of a problem an earlier version of
 *      this file solved one construct (if/else) at a time by
 *      inserting AUNREACHABLE; simply never emitting the dead
 *      instruction at all is simpler still.
 *
 *   3. Loop rotation (findrotation()/rotateonce()/rotateloops()): find
 *      and fix the C `for`/`do while` shape described above, by
 *      physically reordering the now dead-code-free flat instructions
 *      -- see rotateonce()'s own comment for the exact rearrangement
 *      and why it's behaviorally identical to the original.
 *
 *   4. Scope construction (buildscopes()): every surviving branch
 *      target becomes a wasm structural boundary. A forward target
 *      (branch's own position precedes the target) needs an
 *      enclosing block whose end lands there; a backward target
 *      (target at or before the branch) needs an enclosing loop
 *      starting there.
 *
 *   5. Emission (emit()): sweep live positions in order, opening and
 *      closing scopes (as real ABLOCK/ALOOP/AENDCTL Progs) as their
 *      spans dictate, and rewriting each branch's to.offset from a
 *      raw pc into the block/loop nesting depth wasm's br/br_if
 *      actually need.

 * validatescopes() (further down) diag()s on, but detected here, in
 * time to actually fix it (see rotateonce()'s comment for why).
 * Operates on already-live, already-0-based indices (run *after*
 * markdead()/compact(), not before): an earlier version ran on the
 * raw pre-compaction list and kept "fixing" the dead breakpc/continpc
 * trampolines gen() leaves behind (see txt.c's/pgen.c's OWHILE/OFOR
 * comments) right alongside the real entry jump -- each of those
 * trampolines, once correctly retargeted to wherever its destination
 * code now lives, becomes *itself* a forward-branch-into-a-loop's-
 * interior, since it's structurally identical to the real entry jump
 * (both are unconditional branches from outside the loop into it).
 * That reproduced the violation forever instead of fixing it once.
 * Dead code has no such trampolines left (they're exactly what
 * markdead() elides), so running here is both correct and simpler --
 * one call to run at, no base/pcid arithmetic needed.
 *
 * A `continue` inside the loop is *also* a backward ABR targeting the
 * same Lopen as the loop's own automatic back-edge (both ultimately
 * mean "go do the increment") -- so for a given Lopen, Dclose must be
 * 1 + the *largest* matching backward source (matching buildscopes()'
 * own loopclose[] logic just below), not whichever one happens to be
 * found first; using an earlier `continue` as Dclose instead of the
 * real, later back-edge produced a wrong (too-small) loop bound.
 *
 * The backward branch defining a loop's own Dclose isn't always an
 * unconditional ABR either: for a `for` nested directly in another
 * `for`'s body, the outer loop's own automatic back-edge (gen()'s
 * "body finished normally" ABR) is itself unreachable-via-fallthrough
 * dead code once the inner loop is the entire body (the inner loop's
 * own trailing ABR already is the thing right before it) and gets
 * elided by markdead() -- what's left targeting the outer Lopen is
 * the *inner* loop's own conditional test-exit (ABRIF), which just
 * happens to double as "outer loop, keep going" once it falls out of
 * the inner loop. So both ABR and ABRIF count as backward-branch
 * candidates here, matching buildscopes()' own check just below.
 *
 * For nested for/do-while (one directly in the other's body), more
 * than one violation can exist at once, and *which* one gets rotated
 * first matters: rotating the outer one first relocates the inner
 * loop's whole span as one contiguous block (fine, its own internal
 * targets all shift together and stay consistent) -- but rotating the
 * outer one *before* the inner one has been fixed means the outer's
 * "REST" region isn't really one contiguous logical chunk yet, since
 * the still-unrotated inner loop's own increment/back-edge machinery
 * is interleaved into it; rotateonce()'s block-swap then scrambles
 * that interleaving instead of moving a clean unit. So this always
 * returns the *smallest-span* (innermost) violation found, never just
 * the first -- rotateloops() below relies on that to fix nested loops
 * inside-out, each one already-clean by the time an outer one's own
 * rotation moves it as a block.

/*
 * claude: doswit() (compilers/cck/pswt.c, shared by every backend)
 * always emits a switch statement as "body first (case labels recorded
 * inline as gen() walks it), compare-and-dispatch chain after" --
 * irrelevant for a real arch's arbitrary-target branches, but it makes
 * every one of swit1()'s own q[i].label branches (this file's own
 * comment on swit1() -- see swt.c) a *backward* one, which
 * buildscopes() classifies as a loop back-edge no differently than a
 * real for/while's own. That's merely redundant (a wasm `loop` that
 * only ever runs once still validates) when the switch sits on its
 * own, but genuinely unfixable by buildscopes()/extendscopes() when
 * the switch sits inside a real loop that has its own backward back-
 * edge landing in the same region: two LOOP scopes can only nest
 * (unlike two BLOCK scopes, extendscopes() has no "loop" equivalent of
 * widening a block's open point), and a switch's dispatch span and an
 * enclosing loop's own span will partially overlap rather than nest
 * whenever the switch isn't the very last thing in the loop body.
 * Confirmed via tests/c/mini2/print_nofloat_no64.c's vprintf() (a
 * `for` loop containing two switches): silently miscompiled --
 * emit()'s own "branch target scope not on stack" safety diag() didn't
 * even catch it, it just picked the wrong enclosing scope -- into a
 * module that failed wasm validation ("expected 0 elements on the
 * stack for fallthru, found 1"), not the clean "unsupported control
 * flow" validatescopes() gives the for/do-while entry case.
 *
 * The fix: physically relocate each switch's whole dispatch chain
 * (recorded by swit1() via recordswitch()) to right before its own
 * body, via swapspans() above. This turns every q[i].label branch
 * (and the final unconditional branch to `def`) into an *ordinary
 * forward* branch into the body -- exactly what buildscopes() already
 * handles for every other if/while/for -- eliminating the conflict
 * entirely rather than trying to reconcile two overlapping loop
 * scopes. The switch's own *entry* jump (OSWITCH's `gbranch(OGOTO)`,
 * cck/pgen.c) already targets the dispatch chain's start, so after the
 * move it simply becomes "branch to the very next live position" -- a
 * degenerate but valid one-line block, not special-cased away, since
 * emit()'s generic block/loop machinery already handles it for free.
 *
 * Runs once per recorded switch, in whatever order recordswitch()
 * received them (nesting/ordering doesn't matter -- see the comment
 * on curpos[] below); must run *before* rotateloops(), so a switch's
 * own former backward branches never reach findrotation()/buildscopes()
 * at all, and after retarget(), since it needs live-index (not raw
