# Exercises machines/vi (the MIPS emulator/debugger) a bit beyond just
# loading a header (see tests/libmach/smoke.sh for that): reads real
# instruction bytes out of the real text segment of a real Plan9 MIPS
# executable, disassembles them, and runs the program to completion
# through the CPU emulator + syscall layer.
#
# This is a good libmach regression target: vi links against
# lib_toolchain/libmach, and this exercises access.c (memory read)
# together with vdb.c/vcodas.c (the mips disassembler, ported in from
# src/libmach alongside v.c -- see lib_toolchain/libmach/mkfile).
