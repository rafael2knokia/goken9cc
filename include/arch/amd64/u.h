// Plan9 C compiler in this tree, while pointers here are 8 (SZ_IND) --
// confirmed by probe rather than by reading gc.h: `int c =
// sizeof(uintptr);` through 6c -S emits `DATA c+0(SB)/4,$8` next to
// `sizeof(void*)`'s $8, and `sizeof(ulong)`'s $4. So `unsigned long`
// here would make uintptr 4 bytes on a 64-bit arch and silently drop

// states the exact width this bit layout requires, rather than relying
// on whatever `ulong` happens to be. claude: `ulong` is in fact also 4

 *
 * Verified empirically against 6c -S on throwaway probes (both reading
 * a fixed-arg function's own FP offsets, and the caller-side stack
 * layout at a variadic call site): like arm64, every named argument
 * occupies a full 8-byte-aligned stack slot regardless of its actual
 * type width (a preceding int32 still leaves the next arg 8 bytes
 * further along, not 4) -- unlike arm64 though, this isn't a case of
 * rounding a *register-passed* first argument's home slot up to 8;
 * on amd64 there simply is no register-passed argument at all, the
 * caller always writes every argument (including the callee's very
 * first one) to the stack before the call, so a hand-written function
 * (see syscall/arch/amd64/svc.s) can address num+0(FP) directly, with
 * no compiler-prologue spill trick needed the way arm64's/mips's is.
