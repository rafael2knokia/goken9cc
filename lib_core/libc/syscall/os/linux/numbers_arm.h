 * 64-bit -- so a single portable declaration of that struct is

 *
 * The clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep family avoids that completely. On
 * the 32-bit arches we use the *_time64 forms, whose struct
 * __kernel_timespec is {s64 tv_sec; s64 tv_nsec} by definition; on the
 * 64-bit arches plain clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep already have an
 * 8+8 struct timespec. So the SHAPE is two vlongs everywhere, and
 * os/linux/time.c can be one arch-independent file with no #ifdef.
 * They are also y2038-correct, which gettimeofday on 32-bit is not.
 * This is additionally forced on riscv32, which has no gettimeofday or
