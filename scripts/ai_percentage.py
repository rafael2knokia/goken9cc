"""Estimate how much of goken9cc's C/assembly was last written by Claude Code.

Unlike principia-softwarica's docs/scripts/ai_percentage.py, this codebase
has no blank-line-delimited "%claude: paragraph" convention to lean on --
source files just get an inline `/* claude: ... */` or `// claude: ...`
comment dropped next to whatever Claude touched, with no marked end. That
makes a text-based scan unreliable: it can find the *start* of a
Claude-written region but not where it stops.

Instead this script uses `git blame` as the ground truth. Every commit made
through Claude Code in this repo carries a "Co-Authored-By: Claude ..."
trailer (see CLAUDE.md's commit instructions), so for each line currently in
a tracked .c/.h/.s file we look up which commit last touched it and check
whether that commit has the trailer.

IMPORTANT: this repo does a lot of "port this file from src/libmach" /
"import from principia" style commits, where a commit adds a file at a new
path that is substantially (sometimes byte-for-byte) copied from a file that
already existed elsewhere in the tree, untouched by that same commit. Plain
`git blame` has no way to see that -- a file that's new *at that path* gets
100% of its lines credited to whichever commit added it there, even if every
line was copied verbatim from decades-old human code sitting one directory
over. `-C -C` tells git blame to also search the *rest of the parent tree*
(not just files touched in the same commit) for the true origin of each
line, which is exactly this case. It's ~30x slower than plain blame, which
is why this script shells out to `git blame` in parallel across all CPU
cores rather than running it serially.

Caveats:
  - A line "last touched" by a human commit that only reflowed code Claude
    originally wrote will be attributed to the human -- same "blame follows
    the last edit" limitation any git-blame-based metric has.
  - `-C -C` only looks one commit's parent tree deep. A copy of a copy (or a
    copy from a file that was itself later deleted/renamed away) can still
    dead-end at the wrong commit. `-C -C -C` searches full history and is
    noticeably more accurate (see the sym.c spot-check in this script's
    commit message / conversation), but is minutes slower per large file;
    not used here by default.
  - Lines with uncommitted local changes (blame hash all-zero) are excluded
    from the percentage (but not broken out in the report).
