/* This file is the "os/$GOOS/" glue layer, deliberately kept apart
 * from lib_core/libc/syscall/: syscall/ (see _sysopen() there) is just
 * a faithful raw-syscall adapter, one per (OS, arch); this file is
 * where a *different* API shape gets bridged on top of it -- Plan9's
 * fdt open(char*, int) with OREAD/OWRITE/ORDWR/OEXEC/OTRUNC/OCEXEC/
 * ORCLOSE/OEXCL bits (include/os/file.h) instead of POSIX open(2)'s
 * O_RDONLY/O_WRONLY/O_RDWR/O_CREAT/O_TRUNC/... flags. Genuinely
 * OS-specific (the O_* numeric values below differ from Darwin's --
 * see os/darwin/open.c), so it belongs here, not in port/.
 *
 * Linux's fcntl.h O_* flag bits, needed for that translation. These are
 * the "generic" Linux ABI values (asm-generic/fcntl.h), shared by every
 * arch this project targets except mips, which inherited a different,
 * older bit layout for the flags used here -- confirmed against
 * GO/pkg/syscall/zerrors_linux_{386,amd64,arm}.go's O_TRUNC/O_CLOEXEC
 * (identical on all three, and arm64/riscv/riscv64 are new-enough archs
 * to use the same asm-generic header those three do). The mips-specific
 * O_EXCL value is from memory of arch/mips/include/uapi/asm/fcntl.h,
 * NOT yet empirically verified on real mips hardware -- Plan9's OEXCL
 * isn't exercised by tests/c/hello_libc's io.c, so this path hasn't
 * actually been run. Verify before trusting it.

/* claude: Plan9's create() (include/os/dir.h) is open()-with-O_CREAT,

 * in this tree grew a SYS_create. This tree's Unix targets all do have
 * a real creat(2) (386/arm/mips: 8, amd64: 85), but it's useless here:
 * creat() is hardwired to write-only, while Plan9's create() takes a
 * full mode argument and is routinely called with OREAD or ORDWR.
 *
 * Semantics being matched (Plan9's create(2)): the file is created if
 * absent, TRUNCATED IF PRESENT -- unconditionally, not only when the
 * caller passes OTRUNC -- and left open with the access mode given by
 * `mode`. That unconditional O_TRUNC is the one part that doesn't fall
 * out of openflags() above, so it's or'ed in here.
 *
 * `perm` is Plan9's permission word: the low 9 bits are rwxrwxrwx,
 * laid out exactly like POSIX's, so they pass straight through. The
 * high DM* bits (include/os/dir.h) are masked off -- except DMDIR,
 * which in Plan9 means "make a directory instead of a file". POSIX has
 * no way to express that through open(2) at any flag combination, so
 * that case dispatches to mkdir(2) (mkdirat(2) on the archs with no
 * bare mkdir -- see syscall_linux_arm64.h's _sysmkdir) and then opens
 * the result, since Plan9's create() is defined to return the new
 * object already open.
 *
 * BOOT/lib9/open.c's p9create() (the gcc-built reference this tree is
 * meant to stop depending on) is the model, including its refusal of
 * any mode but OREAD for a directory create: there is nothing to write
 * to a directory through an fd, and Plan9 itself rejects it. OCEXEC is
 * allowed through on top of OREAD since it says nothing about access.
