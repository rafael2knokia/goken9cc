/* goken.c -- a third variant, between Plan9.c and Posix.c, for
 * self-hosting mk with goken's own toolchain+libc on a POSIX-shaped
 * GOOS (linux/darwin/windows). See docs/claude_notes/
 * notes_libc_api_design.txt's "Environment (getenv/putenv/environ)"
 * entry for the design story.
 *
 * mk/mkfile's own OFILES picks exactly ONE of Posix.$O/Plan9.$O/
 * goken.$O per build (never two at once), so unlike a header this
 * file cannot share symbols with Plan9.c by simply not redefining
 * them -- every function mk's other files call that isn't defined
 * elsewhere in mk/ has to exist here too. Most of Plan9.c's own code
 * is ALREADY written against the portable Plan9-shaped libc surface
 * goken's own libc implements on every GOOS (dirstat/dirwstat,
 * wait()/waitpid()/exits()), so chgtime()/mkmtime()/xwaitfor()/
 * Exit()/rcopy() below are copied over UNCHANGED, not redesigned --
 * they would compile and behave identically here. Plan9.c's
 * dirtime()/bulkmtime() are dropped, not copied (dead code on this
 * branch -- see the comment at their old call site below). And
 * notifyf()/catchnotes()/expunge() (Tier 6's atnotify()/postnote()/
 * notify(), NOT implemented identically on every GOOS this file
 * targets) live in their own GOOS-selected variant files instead --
 * see the comment at their old call site below, and mk/mkfile's
 * NOTIFYVARIANTOFILES.
 *
 * What genuinely differs, and is the whole reason this file exists:
 *
 * - readenv()/exportenv(): Plan9.c's own versions read/write /env
 *   directly. goken's own environ()/getenv()/putenv() (include/os/
 *   env.h) are the portable equivalent -- see below.
 * - execsh()/pipecmd(): NOT defined in this file at all -- windows has
 *   no fork() to build Plan9.c's own rfork(RFPROC|RFFDG|RFENVG)
 *   pattern on, so these live in their own GOOS-selected files
 *   (mk/exec_fork.c, mk/exec_windows.c) instead. See exec_windows.c's
 *   own header comment and docs/claude_notes/notes_libc_api_design.txt's
 *   "spawn(): a portable process-spawn primitive" section.
 * - maketmp(): mktemp() (include/os/tmp.h) is declared but has zero
 *   implementation anywhere in this tree. Rather than add one just
 *   for this one call site, this builds a pid-based temp path
 *   directly -- mk only needs a name unlikely to collide with another
 *   concurrent mk, not cryptographic uniqueness, and getpid() already
 *   gives that for free.

/* claude: done on the child side of fork() (same convention Plan9.c's

 *
 * Multi-word values are joined with '\1', Posix.c's own IWS
 * ("inter-word separator in env"), NOT with a plain space. This file
 * used to use ' ', on the reasoning that a POSIX child has no business
 * seeing control characters in its environment -- but the child that
 * matters here is rc, and rc splits an imported environment value into
 * a word LIST on '\1' and on nothing else (rc/goken.c and rc/unix.c's
 * enval(), against rc.h's own SEP). Space-joined, every multi-word mk
 * variable arrived in a recipe as ONE word: `$CFLAGS` reached the
 * compiler as a single argv entry "-I../../include -I../../include/ALL
 * -I. ...", which 7c then dutifully tried to open as an include
 * directory named "-I../../include/ALL". Symptom was a self-hosted
 * `7c: no error: u.h` on the very first file of stage 2 of `mk
 * bootstrap`, with the identical 7c binary working perfectly when
 * driven by the boot-gcc-built mk -- because that one is Posix.c, and
 * Posix.c had it right. mk and rc have to agree on this separator;
 * there is no freedom here to pick the nicer-looking one.
 *
 * No unsetenv() equivalent exists in this libc yet (include/os/env.h
 * only has getenv()/putenv()/environ()), so a variable mk wants
 * REMOVED (present in the real symbol table with no value) simply
 * stays inherited from the parent's real environment instead of being
 * deleted -- a real, accepted limitation, not an oversight. Matches
 * this project's "diff-and-putenv is fine" decision: putenv() alone
 * handles the add/update case every real caller in this tree actually
 * needs, and removal was explicitly not asked for.
