/* getenv()/environ() for the POSIX-shaped GOOSes (linux and darwin),
 * which reach the environment identically: it is NOT a syscall at
 * all, it is memory the kernel already laid on the initial stack.
 * Immediately past argv's terminating nil sits the environment, a
 * nil-terminated array of "NAME=value" strings. So this whole file
 * needs no syscall layer and lives in port/ rather than os/$GOOS/ --
 * the one call in this group where linux and darwin genuinely agree.
 *
 * They agree because it is the SysV ABI's process-startup contract, not
 * a Linux invention. plan9 and windows have neither that contract nor
 * that memory layout, and get their own os/$GOOS/getenv.c.
 *
 * _mainargv is stashed by arch/$cputype/rt0.s -- see port/mainargs.c
 * for why argv rather than an envp computed there.

 * sites across the toolchain, all one-shot configuration lookups like
 * $objtype/$GOROOT), so there was never a reason to cache just for
 * that. Once putenv() (port/putenv.c) allocates a real, growable
 * array of its own, it stores it here and this becomes the answer
 * from then on -- the kernel-provided block can't be grown or
 * shrunk in place, so a mutation has to switch to a new one entirely,
