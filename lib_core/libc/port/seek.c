/* Plan9's include/os/file.h calls this seek(), not lseek() -- purely a
 * naming difference on every OTHER OS, not a behavioral one:
 * SEEK__START/SEEK__CUR/SEEK__END (0/1/2) already match POSIX's
 * SEEK_SET/SEEK_CUR/SEEK_END numerically everywhere, so this is a
 * genuinely portable, OS/arch-independent renaming shim there --
 * unlike open()'s translation (os/$GOOS/open.c), which needs real
 * per-OS flag-bit knowledge and so lives under os/ instead.
 *
 * plan9 and windows are excluded from this file's compilation
 * entirely, rather than #ifdef'd out inside it: plan9's own real
 * seek(2) syscall is already named/shaped exactly like the public
 * seek() (syscall/os/plan9/svc_$cputype.s defines the symbol
 * directly), and windows has no raw-syscall layer at all, so
 * os/windows/open.c defines seek() itself on top of winio_amd64.s's
 * _winseek. On both, linking this shim in would either fail to resolve
 * `lseek` (neither has such a symbol) or collide with the real seek().
 * That selection lives in lib_core/libc/mkfile's PORTPOSIXOFILES --
 * see its comment. This file used to carry a `#ifndef plan9 / #ifndef
 * windows` pair for the same purpose; it was moved out to keep port/
 * free of GOOS branching.
 */

/* lseek()'s own return type differs by arch: on the archs with a real
 * 64-bit register to return a `vlong` off_t in (amd64/arm64/riscv64 --
 * riscv64 only on Linux, amd64/arm64 on both Linux and Darwin), its
 * raw syscall wrapper (lib_core/libc/syscall/os/$OS/) routes through
 * _syscall6v and genuinely returns `vlong`; every other (32-bit) arch
 * still returns plain `long` via the default _syscall6 (see
 * scripts/mksyscall.sh's own comment on the two trampolines, and
 * syscall_linux_amd64.h's _syscall6v comment for why a second
 * trampoline was added instead of widening _syscall6 itself).
 *
 * claude: nested #ifdef, not `#if defined(X) || defined(Y)` -- 7c/vc/ic's
 * preprocessor doesn't understand `#if` with an expression at all
 * ("unknown #: if"), only plain #ifdef/#ifndef/#else/#endif (see every
 * other #ifdef in lib_core/libc, e.g. os/linux/open.c's `#ifdef mips`,
 * none of which use `#if`).
