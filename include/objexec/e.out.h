/*
 * wasm (WebAssembly), arch letter 'e'.
 *
 * claude: modeled on include/[568vi].out.h for the other architectures.
 * Follows v.out.h/i.out.h specifically for the
 * D_* enum: one enum namespace, split across Gen's `type` and `name`
 * fields (type = operand encoding, name = memory region for a D_OREG),
 * rather than either arm's two separate enum types (Operand_kind/
 * Sym_kind) or x86/amd64's single additive-D_INDIR field.
 *
 * Scope: the WASM MVP (2017) instruction set only -- i32/i64/f32/f64,
 * linear memory, structured control flow. No SIMD (v128), no
 * threads/atomics, no exception-handling or tail-call proposals: none
 * of those are needed to compile the C subset this toolchain targets,
 * and they can be added later the same way other arches grew opcodes.
 *
 * claude: wasm has no fixed register file, which changes the shape of
 * this header more than any single-arch difference elsewhere in the
 * project:
 *   - No REGRET/REGSP/REGTMP-as-hardware-register. Call arguments and
 *     results simply live on wasm's implicit operand stack, in the
 *     order given by the function's type -- there is no register to
 *     name for "the return value".
 *   - What every other arch calls a "register" (D_REG) splits into two
 *     unrelated wasm concepts here: D_LOCAL (a typed, per-function
 *     local, addressed by index -- there is no cross-function/global
 *     register file, and no spilling: a fresh local can be allocated
 *     per live temporary) and D_GLOBAL (a typed, module-level global;
 *     currently only used for the shadow stack pointer, see SPGLOBAL
 *     below).
 *   - A wasm local's *address* cannot be taken (unlike a stack slot on
 *     a real machine). So D_AUTO/D_PARAM keep their usual meaning only
 *     for values that never have their address taken (compiled to a
 *     true D_LOCAL); anything address-taken must instead live in a
 *     conventional linear-memory "shadow stack", addressed relative to
 *     SPGLOBAL exactly like D_AUTO/D_PARAM work on every other arch.
 *     Telling those two cases apart is ec's job, not this header's.
 *   - D_BRANCH's value is a structured-control label depth (how many
 *     enclosing block/loop/if constructs to exit), not a PC/address --
 *     wasm has no unstructured jump. The assembler resolves depths from
 *     ABLOCK/ALOOP/AIF/AENDCTL nesting, the same way other arches'
 *     assemblers resolve D_BRANCH into a PC-relative displacement.
 *   - No NREG/REGMIN/REGMAX/REGEXT-style register-allocation range:
 *     there is nothing to allocate from. No NOSPLIT either: wasm's
 *     call stack is host-managed and can't be segmented/grown the way
 *     NOSPLIT guards against on a real machine.
 *
 * claude: no virtual AMOVx here, unlike an earlier draft of this file.
 * Every other arch's AMOVx works as one 2-operand mnemonic because
 * there's always a *register* to be the other side of a load, a
 * store, or a constant load -- the same instruction, just aimed at
 * different places. wasm has no register to play that role, so
 * forcing everything through one MOV-shaped mnemonic just made the
 * arity silently change meaning (sometimes one operand meaning "push
 * and leave it on the stack", sometimes two meaning "move"), which is
 * exactly the kind of surprise a programmer coming from 5a/8a/ia
 * would *not* expect from something called MOVW. Instead, each opcode
 * below matches one real wasm instruction, with exactly the operand
 * *that instruction's own encoding* carries -- see each section's
 * comment. What still carries over deliberately: SB/SP/FP (still
 * meaningful pseudo-registers), TEXT/GLOBL/DATA/WORD (identical
 * concept), and CALL/RET/BR (still "control transfer with an
 * operand").

/*
 * claude: NSYM and Ieee are NOT redefined here (unlike v.out.h/i.out.h,
 * which are self-contained headers with no other shared include).
 * e.out.h is meant to be reached the way 5.out.h/8.out.h are: through
 * assemblers/Xa's shared aa.h (assemblers/as/aa.h), which already
 * pulls in include/common.out.h for both. Including this header any
 * other way must arrange for common.out.h itself first.

 * in this project). wasm has no register to pass it in, so -1 here

/*
 * type/name, one enum namespace split across Gen's two fields, same
 * convention as v.out.h/i.out.h: Gen.type holds one of the "type"
 * values below and says how the instruction encodes the operand;
 * Gen.name holds one of the "name" values and, only when
 * type==D_OREG, says which linear-memory region a symbol is relative
 * to. Unlike x86/amd64's D_INDIR, name is not additive onto type --
 * there is exactly one symbol-reference type (D_OREG), because
 * D_LOCAL/D_GLOBAL (wasm locals/globals) never take a name: they are
 * never memory references, so the distinction doesn't apply to them.
 *
 * claude: D_OREG no longer means "the address a load/store reads or
 * writes" the way it did in an earlier draft (see the AMOVx comment
 * above) -- ALOADx/ASTOREx below take a plain offset, not an address,
 * because that's what their real wasm encoding carries. D_OREG now
 * means "a reference to a symbol's address", used only where that's
 * still genuinely needed: ea's grammar folds a `name(SB)` operand
 * into a D_OREG while parsing ACALL's target or ACONSTx's
 * address-of-symbol form (see those opcodes' comments), and ACALL's
 * target stays D_OREG all the way into the object file, for el to
 * resolve into a function index.
