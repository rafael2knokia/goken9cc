 * offsets) AND actual qemu-riscv execution of a real va_start/va_arg
 * sequence (not just static -S inspection -- see the riscv64 comment
 * below for why the latter mattered): like arm64/mips, only the
 * *first* named parameter arrives in a register (R8) -- a compiler-
 * generated function only spills it to its home slot (arg+0(FP)) if
 * its address is actually taken, so hand-written assembly (see
 * syscall/arch/riscv/svc.s) must read it from R8 directly. Every
 * *other* argument packs at its natural sizeof() width (like mips),
 * EXCEPT: unlike mips, any 8-byte-or-wider type (double, vlong) forces
 * the list pointer to round up to the next 8-byte-aligned address
 * first -- confirmed by a case that only fails without this rounding
 * (an int immediately followed by a double as the first two varargs).
