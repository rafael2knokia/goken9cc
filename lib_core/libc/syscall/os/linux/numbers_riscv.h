// in this ABI, so remove() is a shim over unlinkat() in
// syscall_linux_riscv.h. Unlike syscall 62 below (which is llseek, not
// lseek, on this 32-bit arch -- see its own comment), both of these are
// marked "common" in scripts/syscall.tbl, so rv32 and rv64 genuinely do
// share them.
// claude: mkdirat -- see numbers_arm64.h; rmdir is unlinkat+AT_REMOVEDIR.

 * 64-bit -- so a single portable declaration of that struct is
 * impossible, and every consumer would need an arch-dependent layout.
 *
 * The clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep family avoids that completely. On
 * the 32-bit arches we use the *_time64 forms, whose struct
 * __kernel_timespec is {s64 tv_sec; s64 tv_nsec} by definition; on the
 * 64-bit arches plain clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep already have an
 * 8+8 struct timespec. So the SHAPE is two vlongs everywhere, and
 * os/linux/time.c can be one arch-independent file with no #ifdef.
 * They are also y2038-correct, which gettimeofday on 32-bit is not.
 * This is additionally forced on riscv32, which has no gettimeofday or
 * nanosleep at all (see numbers_riscv.h).

 * execve=221 are unconditional in scripts/syscall.tbl ("common"), so
 * fork (via clone(SIGCHLD,...), same as arm64/riscv64) and exec would
 * work fine here. wait4, however, is gated exactly like stat's
 * fstat/newfstatat:
 *
 *   260  time32  wait4  sys_wait4  compat_sys_wait4
 *   260  64      wait4  sys_wait4
 *

 * `#if defined(__ARCH_WANT_TIME32_SYSCALLS) || __BITS_PER_LONG != 32`
 * -- the exact condition this file's own clock_gettime/nanosleep
 * comment above already established riscv never defines. So rv32 has
 * no wait4 at all, only waitid (95, unconditional) -- a different
 * struct (siginfo_t, not a plain int status + rusage), needing its own
 * decode logic, not a drop-in. Rather than build fork/exec alone
 * without wait to pair them, this whole tier is deferred here as one
 * gap, same "documented, not silently dropped" treatment as stat's.
