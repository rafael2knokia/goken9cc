/* fork()/exec()/wait()/pipe() -- Tier 4 process control
 * (docs/claude_notes/plan_syscalls.txt), the first tier whose calls
 * this libc did not already have a portable Plan9-shaped wrapper for
 * on any GOOS before this round. All four together are exactly what
 * compilers/pcc/pcc.c's own doexec()/dopipe() need to spawn and pipe
 * between subcommands -- the actual self-hosting milestone the plan
 * doc names this tier for -- so this test exercises them the same way
 * pcc.c does: fork+wait, fork+exec+wait, and pipe+fork+wait.
 *
 * The exec() half re-execs THIS SAME BINARY rather than depending on
 * some other program being present: exec()/execve() do no $PATH search
 * at all, matching real Plan9 exec(2) (see port/exec.c's own comment),
 * so there is nothing else in this test tree guaranteed to be at a
 * known, arch-matching path. "child" is passed as an extra argument so
 * the re-exec'd process can tell itself apart from a normal run.
 * argv[0] (what this process was invoked as) is what gets re-exec'd --
 * args.c's own comment explains why that's usable here even though its
 * exact value is never printed: it differs across environments (qemu
 * vs native, different tmp dirs), but is always a valid path back to
 * this same binary since cwd is unchanged across fork()/exec().
 *
 * $GOKEN_EXEC_PREFIX exists for the one case where re-exec'ing argv[0]
 * is not enough: under qemu-user, execve() is NOT emulated -- qemu
 * hands it straight to the HOST kernel, which can only honour it if it
 * can run this arch's binaries itself (natively, or via a binfmt_misc
 * registration). scripts/qemu-runner deliberately does not rely on
 * binfmt_misc (see its header), so on a host of a different arch the
 * exec below would just fail with ENOEXEC -- and did, in CI: an
 * arm binary re-exec'ing itself works on an arm64 host (which runs
 * aarch32 natively) but not on an amd64 one. So qemu-runner exports
 * the absolute path of the emulator it used, and we re-exec
 * "<emulator> <argv[0]> child" instead: exec'ing the emulator is a
 * host-native exec the host kernel always accepts, and the child still
 * ends up running this same cross-compiled binary. Unset (native runs
 * -- macOS, or a host that matches the target) means the plain
 * re-exec of argv[0] above.
