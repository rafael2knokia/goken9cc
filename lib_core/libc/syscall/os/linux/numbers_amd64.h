 * 64-bit -- so a single portable declaration of that struct is
 * impossible, and every consumer would need an arch-dependent layout.
 *
 * The clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep family avoids that completely. On
 * the 32-bit arches we use the *_time64 forms, whose struct
 * __kernel_timespec is {s64 tv_sec; s64 tv_nsec} by definition; on the
 * 64-bit arches plain clock_gettime/clock_nanosleep already have an
 * 8+8 struct timespec. So the SHAPE is two vlongs everywhere, and
 * os/linux/time.c can be one arch-independent file with no #ifdef.
 * They are also y2038-correct, which gettimeofday on 32-bit is not.
 * This is additionally forced on riscv32, which has no gettimeofday or
 * nanosleep at all (see numbers_riscv.h).

 * common rt_sigreturn sys_rt_sigreturn", "62 common kill sys_kill").

 * reads/writes -- NOT glibc's struct sigaction (different layout).
 * Deliberately the SIMPLE (non-SA_SIGINFO) handler shape, `void
 * (*)(int)`, matching plan9port's own BOOT/lib9/notify.c (confirmed
 * real, working precedent, not guessed) -- os/linux/notify.c's own
 * dispatcher only ever needs the signal NUMBER (to look up a note
 * string), never siginfo_t/ucontext_t, so there is nothing to gain
 * from the 3-argument form and a real category of struct-layout
 * mistakes to lose by using it.
 *
 * Field widths matter more here than in most raw structs in this
 * tree: this compiler's own `long`/`ulong` are ALWAYS 4 bytes even on
 * 64-bit arches (see numbers_amd64.h's sibling files' own comments,
 * and os/linux/stat_amd64.c's identical warning for Kstat) -- but the
 * real kernel struct's sa_flags/sa_mask fields are the ARCH's native
 * word width, 8 bytes here. So flags/mask are uvlong, matching
 * Kstat's own explicit-width discipline, not the bare ulong that
 * would silently misalign restorer/mask by 4 bytes each. mask is a
 * SINGLE uvlong (not an array): amd64's kernel sigset_t is
 * _NSIG_WORDS=1 (_NSIG=64, BITS_PER_LONG=64) -- confirmed empirically
 * on this project's own arm64 host (identical generic-ABI sigset
 * story, see numbers_arm64.h) and cross-checked against mips's very
 * different _NSIG=128/_NSIG_WORDS=4 story (numbers_mips.h) to make
