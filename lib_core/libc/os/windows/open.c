/* Windows' Plan9-API glue -- open()/read()/write()/close()/seek(),
 * include/os/file.h's shapes, on top of winio_amd64.s's raw kernel32
 * stubs. Unlike Linux/Darwin, there's no separate syscall/ "raw
 * adapter" layer for Windows at all: kernel32.dll IS the one stable
 * ABI applications are meant to call (there's no documented raw
 * NT-syscall-number convention the way Linux/BSD expose one), so the
 * kernel32-calling stubs themselves already live under this os/
 * glue directory instead of a syscall/os/windows/ that would otherwise
 * just be a thin, pointless pass-through.
 *
 * Wired via 'GOOS=windows OSEXTRAFILES=os/windows/winio_$cputype.$O
 * SYSCALLOFILES=' on lib_core/libc/mkfile's command line (see that
 * mkfile's OSFILES/SYSCALLOFILES comments) and verified with a real
 * native build+run on a Windows/Cygwin host -- see
 * tests/c/hello_libc/mkfile's test_windows target and
 * docs/claude_notes/notes_os_windows.txt.
 *
 * The bigger known simplification: fdt is `int` (include/os/file.h)
 * but a real Win32 HANDLE is an 8-byte pointer -- open()'s return value
 * truncates it, and read()/write()/close()/seek() widen it back
 * (sign-extending through vlong). Fine for the small handle values
 * CreateFileA happens to return in practice, not guaranteed by the
 * Win32 API contract. A real fix would keep a small fd-to-HANDLE table
 * instead; not attempted here, flagged as a known gap rather than
 * silently assumed correct.

 * Note dup() is deliberately absent from this file, unlike every other

 * until fd numbers stop being truncated HANDLEs (this file's header
 * comment), since dup(old, newfd) has to place a descriptor at a
