# Regression tests for lib_toolchain/libmach's consumers: linkers/ar (iar),
# debuggers/acid, machines/5i, machines/vi.
#
# These four all link against lib_toolchain/libmach (-lmach). iar was
# always on it; acid/5i/vi were switched over from the go-era
# src/libmach (-lmach_) when lib_toolchain/libmach's map.c/sym.c/
# access.c/machdata.c/executable.c/elf.h/7.c/v.c/vdb.c/vcodas.c/linux.c
# were ported in from src/libmach (see lib_toolchain/libmach/mkfile
# history). The switch is easy to get wrong silently: `mk`/`make test`
# only check that these tools *compile and link*, not that libmach's
# executable-header decoding actually works at runtime -- e.g.
# lib_toolchain/libmach's old executable.c had no ELF e_machine==ARM
# case at all (only Plan9/Inferno "boot image" recognition), so acid
# linked fine but failed with "can't decode file header" on every real
# ELF binary until executable.c/elf.h/macho.h/bootexec.h were ported
# in too. These tests pin that down so it can't regress unnoticed.

# Resolve any tool given as a RELATIVE path to an absolute one, up
# front. The iar test below cd's into a temp directory before invoking
# $IAR, so a relative path would be resolved against /tmp/... and fail
# with "command not found" -- while a bare command name (the defaults
# above) must be left alone for $PATH to find.
#
# This directory's mkfile does pass relative paths ($TOP/linkers/ar/
# o.out, TOP=../..). That was latent for a long time because rc's
# Updenv() was a no-op, so "IAR=... bash smoke.sh" never actually
# reached this script and the $PATH-installed tools were used instead --
# which defeated the mkfile's stated intent of testing the freshly built
# binaries rather than whatever `mk install` last left around. Fixing
# rc exposed it. See tests/rc/env_export.sh.
