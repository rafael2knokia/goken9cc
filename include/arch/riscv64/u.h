/* riscv64 (rv64) base types for goken's own toolchain (jc/ja/jl)
 *
 * Typedefs adapted from ~/xxx/miller-riscv/ROOT/riscv64/include/u.h
 * (Richard Miller's Plan9 riscv64 port -- see plan9front.txt's "riscv"
 * section)
 * va_start/va_arg verified
 * (not just copied) against real jc -S output and actual qemu-riscv64
 * execution, same methodology as riscv/u.h.
 *
 * CRITICAL and easy to get wrong: like every other Plan9 C compiler in
 * this tree, jc's `long` is 4 bytes even here, on a genuine 64-bit
 * arch (confirmed: sizeof(long)==4 via a direct probe) -- but pointers
 * are 8 bytes. uintptr/intptr below are deliberately `unsigned long
 * long`/`long long` (vlong-width), NOT `unsigned long`/`long`. claude:
 * this is not an rv64 quirk -- arm64's and amd64's u.h do exactly the
 * same, for exactly the same reason. 6c and 7c both have SZ_LONG 4
 * with SZ_IND 8, just like jc (confirmed by probe: `sizeof(uintptr)`
 * emits $8 alongside `sizeof(void*)`'s $8 and `sizeof(ulong)`'s $4).
 * Do not assume any arch in this tree has a pointer-wide `long`.
 * Using `ulong` here would silently truncate any
 * pointer cast through it to 32 bits -- this is exactly what happened
 * while deriving this file's own va_arg alignment logic (a `(uintptr)
 * list` cast through a wrongly-`ulong`-typed uintptr corrupted the
 * pointer and segfaulted under qemu; switching to `unsigned long long`
 * fixed it immediately, no other change needed). The same trap applies
 * to lib_core/libc/syscall/os/linux/syscall_linux_riscv64.h's
 * _syscall6 declaration -- see that file's own comment.

 * *pointer*, since uintptr is 8 bytes here unlike rv32) forcing the
