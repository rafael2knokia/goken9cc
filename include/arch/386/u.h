 *
 * Verified empirically against 8c -S output: unlike every arm-family
 * arch here (arm64, mips, riscv), 386 passes *no* argument in a
 * register at all -- like amd64, every argument (including the
 * callee's first) is written to the stack by the caller, so
 * syscall/arch/386/svc.s can address num+0(FP) directly. Unlike
 * amd64 though, there's no uniform-8-byte-slot rounding here either:
 * every argument packs at its exact natural sizeof() width, with no
 * padding/alignment at all (confirmed: a double placed right after an
 * int+long pair lands with zero gap, and the next int right after the
 * double also lands with zero gap) -- classic i386 weak stack
 * alignment, unlike amd64's or riscv's stricter rules. Since values
 * are little-endian, a narrower-than-4-byte value sits at the *start*
 * of its 4-byte slot (unlike big-endian mips, which needs the *end*).
