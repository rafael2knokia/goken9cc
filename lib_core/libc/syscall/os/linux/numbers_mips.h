 * 8+8 struct timespec. So the SHAPE is two vlongs everywhere, and
 * os/linux/time.c can be one arch-independent file with no #ifdef.
 * They are also y2038-correct, which gettimeofday on 32-bit is not.

/* claude: Tier 6 notification -- see numbers_amd64.h's fuller comment
 * for the general design (Ksigaction, simple non-SA_SIGINFO handler
 * shape). MIPS o32 diverges further than any other arch here, in
 * three independently confirmed ways (arch/mips/kernel/syscalls/
 * syscall_o32.tbl and arch/mips/include/uapi/asm/signal.h, real
 * kernel source, not guessed -- this arch has burned this project
 * before: sysm_pipe's register-pair return, the renameat2 5th-arg
 * drop, both docs/claude_notes/notes_libc_selfhost.txt entries):
 *
 * 1. Numbers: kill=4037 (+4000 legacy base, same as every other o32
 *    syscall here), rt_sigaction=4194, rt_sigreturn=4193.
 * 2. Signal range: MIPS's _NSIG is 128, not 64 like every other arch
 *    in this tree (arch/mips/include/uapi/asm/signal.h: "SIGRTMIN as
 *    32... SIGRTMAX as _NSIG", 96 realtime signals instead of the
 *    usual 32) -- so the kernel sigset_t here is _NSIG_WORDS=4 (128 /
 *    32-bit word), 16 bytes, not the 8-byte/2-word shape numbers_386.h/
 *    numbers_arm.h/numbers_riscv.h share despite also being 32-bit.
 * 3. Struct shape: MIPS's own struct sigaction is `{sa_flags;
 *    sa_handler; sa_mask;}` -- flags FIRST, unlike every other arch's
 *    handler-first layout -- and has NO sa_restorer field at all: the
 *    kernel source's own comment says SA_RESTORER support "was
 *    removed" from MIPS entirely (only O32 ever used it, no libc did),
 *    so the kernel unconditionally supplies its own return mechanism.
 *    SA_SIGINFO's value is also different here: 0x00000008, not the
 *    0x00000004 every other arch in this tree uses.
 *
 * Net effect: os/linux/notify.c needs exactly one narrow `#ifdef mips`
 * (matching existing precedent for this, e.g. os/linux/open.c's own
 * O_CREAT/O_EXCL split) around the handful of lines that build/install
 * the Ksigaction, since this arch has no restorer field to fill in and
 * a differently-shaped mask array -- everything else (the note-string
 * table, the setjmp/longjmp-based noted() dispatch, postnote()) is
 * unchanged.
